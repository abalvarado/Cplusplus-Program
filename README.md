# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, the company Chada Tech wants thier clients to be able to view a 12-hour clock and 24-hour clock on their website.
They are requiring that both clocks display simultaneously along with a menu for the user to perfrom an action. These actions include: adding one hour, adding one minute, adding one second, or exiting the program. Depending on the selection, the both clocks should display simultaneously with the change, or exit the program if that option is selected. 

# What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I choose to use a switch statment that executed based on the user input for each menu option. Besides the default function, which captured invalid entries, or the last case, which broke immediatley and exited the program, each case calls two functions to perform calculations and then display the new clocks. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance this code by limiting the amount of code in the main and in the main .cpp file and create classes along with a class file and objects to eliminate reptative code. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The section of code that I found most challenging to write was the code related to time and it's conversions. The zybooks only mentioned the time type time_t once, so I had to do research to find the defintions and headers to enable the use of the localtime() function using cplusplus .com. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Almost everything I learned from this project can be transfereable; learning how to format code to set and fill characters, using proper headers to enable certain fuinctions, creating and using user-defined functions, the use of branches and loops.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make this program more maintainable, readable, and adaptale; in-line comments to explain the code and context, used clear and readable names for variables and functions, and used a switch statment for minimal complexity.
